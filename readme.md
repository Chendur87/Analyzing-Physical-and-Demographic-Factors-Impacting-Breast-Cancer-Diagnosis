# Final Project Instructions
>  The code is split into 3 classes, one for each research question.
>  When you run the code, the plots for Research Question 1 will appear under `research_question_one_plots`,
>  and the plots for Research Question 2 will appear under `research_question_two_plots`.
>  The statistical analysis for Research Question One and the Machine Learning Output from
>  Research Question Three will be printed to the console. The ML takes some time to complete, but the estimate time of
>  completion of all of the code is around 2 minutes (with ML taking around 90 seconds).
>
>  For the plots, I visually inspected them and they seem good to me.
>  Lastly, I decided not to do any testing for Research Question 3 because the datasets were very clean without too much
>  manipulation required and I was confident in the results of the ML model with over 90% testing accuracy.
>  The main goal of the ML was to be more confident on the features that differentiate between malignant vs. benign tumors
>  (cancer vs. non-cancer patients), and the results of the ML model for the top 3 features (radius, perimeter, and concave
>  points) that contributed to the model supports the hypothesis testing, since those features always rejected the null
>  hypothesis of having no significant difference between the malignant and benign populations. Therefore, I'm confident
>  that the ML supports my statistical findings without testing needed.
